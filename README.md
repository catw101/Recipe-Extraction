## Concept
This will be an application that extracts ingredients from the recipe(s) link(s) that you provide and adds them to your online shopping cart (Costco, Amazon, etc). There will be several options of how you want items to be added to your list (ex: lowest prices, best deals, highest ratings). This will save you the hassle and time of searching for the best deals on your own. A potential additional feature would be to search on multiple sites and give the best deals overall.
